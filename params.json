{"name":"Storytime","tagline":"A webapp written with CherryPy for creating and organizing storyboards.","body":"Storytime was written to provide a simple way to manage and share storyboards. I found that there wasn't really any software to do this. One obvious reason for that might be that creating a storyboard is relatively easy with a list of files: just number a bunch of pictures and throw them in a folder. But what if you want to reorder them? How do you easily add notes to each shot? How do you share them? There's probably all sorts of hack-ish techniques out there, such as a shared Google doc or a private wiki, but I wanted something a little more simple, elegant, and to the point.\r\n\r\nVoil√†!","google":"UA-299025-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
